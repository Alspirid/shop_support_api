# Shop​ ​Support​ ​API coding challenge project

There are times when shops want to sell fonts that require a license key to use. One pain point that
exists: they have to manually message customers through Creative Market after every purchase to
provide when with a license key.
We want to empower shops to automatically send a license key to a customer without exposing
customer data (like an email) to the shop. We already send the shop a webhook for every sale that
includes some customer information and an order ID, so we'd like to introduce an API endpoint to
enable this new workflow feature!
